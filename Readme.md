**Automatic 3D+t four-chamber CMR quantification of the UK biobank: 
integrating imaging and non-imaging data priors at scale**

>MCSI-Net (Multi-Cue Shape Inference Network), where we embed a statistical shape model 
inside a convolutional neural network and leverage both phenotypic and demographic information
from the cohort to infer subject-specific reconstructions of all four cardiac chambers in 3D. 
In this way, we leverage the ability of the network to learn the appearance of cardiac chambers
in cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imag
